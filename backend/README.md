# EasyTalk Backend

This directory contains the FastAPI backend of the EasyTalk project.

The root `README.md` in the repository holds the full documentation.  This file exists only so that Poetry can successfully install the backend package when `readme = "README.md"` is specified in `pyproject.toml`.
